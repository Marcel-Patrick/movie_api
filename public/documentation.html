    <h1>Objective</h1>
    <p>
      <h4>
        To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
        application will provide users with access to information about different
        movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
        personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

      <ul>
        <li>The API must be a Node.js and Express application.</li>
        <li>The API must use REST architecture, with URL endpoints corresponding to the data operations listed above</li>
        <li>The API must use at least three middleware modules, such as the body-parser package for reading data from requests and morgan for logging.</li>
        <li>The API must use a “package.json” file.</li>
        <li>The database must be built using MongoDB.</li>
        <li>The business logic must be modeled with Mongoose.</li>
